# Brazilian Data Validation API - Terms of Use

## 1. General Disclaimer
This API provides syntactic validation for Brazilian documents (CPF and CNPJ) and address lookups via ZIP code (CEP). By using this service, you acknowledge that:
- **Syntactic Validation Only:** The validation is strictly mathematical/structural. The API checks if the numbers follow the official Brazilian document formatting algorithms.
- **No Ownership Verification:** This service **does not** verify if the document belongs to a specific individual or company, nor does it check for legal validity or active status in government databases (e.g., Receita Federal).
- **Public Services Dependency:** Address lookups (CEP) are performed through third-party public services (ViaCEP). We do not guarantee the uptime or accuracy of these external services.

## 2. Data Privacy & LGPD
- This API does not store any personal data processed during validation. 
- Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of this API complies with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (**LGPD**) and any other applicable local regulations.

## 3. Limitation of Liability
- This API is provided "as is" without any warranties. 
- The developers shall not be held liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use or inability to use this service, including decisions made based on validation results.

## 4. Acceptable Use
- You agree not to use the API for any illegal activities or to attempt to disrupt the service through abusive request rates (beyond what is allowed by your RapidAPI plan).
